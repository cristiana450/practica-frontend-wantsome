                      <p>Butterflies are beautiful, flying insects with large scaly wings. Like all insects, they have six jointed legs, 3 body parts, a pair of antennae, compound eyes, and an exoskeleton. ... The butterfly's body is covered by tiny sensory hairs. The four wings and the six legs of the butterfly are attached to the thorax.</p>
                      <p>Butterflies are characterized by wings.</p>

                            <h4>Wings</h4>
                            <p>Butterfly adults are characterized by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, but many of the blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.</p>
