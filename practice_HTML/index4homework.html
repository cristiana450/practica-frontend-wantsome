    <h1>Butterflies in Romania</h1>
    <hr width="100%">

    <p>Romania is recognized throughout Europe for its natural riches, it is also one of Europe’s top destinations for birdwatching, but this beautiful country located on the edge of the continent, it is not known for its wild treasures, such as butterflies. Because there are still many areas where agriculture is traditionally like a hundred years ago, using environmentally friendly techniques and wildlife, butterflies thrive in this region. Vivid colored butterflies flying from flower to flower, are still a common presence on mountain pastures, meadows and forest steppe grasslands of Romania. At least 200 species of butterflies have been identified in Romania.</p>
